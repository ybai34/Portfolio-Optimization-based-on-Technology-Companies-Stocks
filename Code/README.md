# Code Repository

Welcome to the Code Repository for Portfolio Optimization based on Technology Companies Stocks project. This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to perform a variety of financial computations and optimizations to help you understand and apply the principles of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to real-world data.

## Repository Contents

- `Data_Analysis.ipynb`: A notebook for initial financial data analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization of financial time series data.

- `Markowitz_Max_Sharpe.ipynb`: A script dedicated to calculating the optimal portfolio with the maximum Sharpe ratio, showcasing the best risk-adjusted return as per Markowitz's model.

- `Markowitz_companies_mean.ipynb`: This notebook calculates the mean returns of companies within the portfolio, a vital step for subsequent optimization processes.

- `Markowitz_min_risk.ipynb`: Focuses on assembling the minimum risk (or variance) portfolio composition, a key element of the Markowitz optimization framework.

- `Markowitz_min_risk_1.4.ipynb`
- `Markowitz_min_risk_1.6.ipynb`
- `Markowitz_min_risk_1.8.ipynb`: These versions of the minimal risk portfolio calculations explore different constraints and parameters within the optimization algorithm.

- `Plot.ipynb`: Used for graphing the outcomes of portfolio optimizations, such as plotting the efficient frontier, each asset's risk-return profile, and other pertinent financial visuals.

- `prox_2020.ipynb`: Implements the Proximal Gradient Method with a restrictive condition, mandating a minimum of 20% investment in both AAPL and META stocks.

- `risk_parity.ipynb`: Engages in computations to reach risk parity in a portfolio, aiming for an equal risk contribution from each asset to the total portfolio risk.
