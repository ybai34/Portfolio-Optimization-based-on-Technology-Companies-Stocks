# Code Repository
This repository contains Jupyter notebook codes for performing various financial analyses and portfolio optimizations based on the Modern Portfolio Theory by Harry Markowitz. Below is a description of each file's purpose:

## Data_Analysis.ipynb
This notebook is used for the initial analysis of financial data. It include data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization of financial time series data.

## Markowitz_Max_Sharpe.ipynb
This script calculates the optimal portfolio with the maximum Sharpe ratio, representing the best risk-adjusted return according to Markowitz's optimization model.

## Markowitz_companies_mean.ipynb
This notebook intend for calculating the mean returns of the companies included in the portfolio, which is a critical input for the optimization process.

## Markowitz_min_risk.ipynb
The focus of this notebook is finding the minimum risk (or variance) portfolio composition, another core aspect of the Markowitz optimization framework.

## Markowitz_min_risk_1.4.ipynb
## Markowitz_min_risk_1.6.ipynb
## Markowitz_min_risk_1.8.ipynb
These three notebooks are variations or versions of the minimal risk portfolio calculations, experimenting with different constraints or parameters in the optimization algorithm.

## Plot.ipynb
This script is used to plot the results of the portfolio optimizations, such as the efficient frontier, individual asset risk-return profiles, and other relevant financial charts.

## README.md
The markdown document you are currently reading, which provides an overview and description of the other files in the repository.

## prox_2020.ipynb
This code uses Proximal Gradient Method with restrictive condition basd on buying At least 20% of AAPL and 20% of META properties.

## risk_parity.ipynb
This notebook involves calculations to achieve risk parity in a portfolio, a strategy that allocates capital based on the risk, ensuring that each asset contributes equally to the overall portfolio risk.
